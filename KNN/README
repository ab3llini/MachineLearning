-> In order to run the code you need to have the following libraries installed:

numpy
tqdm (used for progress bar on computations)
matplotlib
{operator, random should be already installed}

-> The python version should be 3.6.x

-> To run the code snippets you should run ocr.py for the first part and iris.py for the second one.

as usual, you can cd in the KNN folder and call "python3 ocr.py" or "python3 iris.py"
